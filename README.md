### Q1 - Iterator - q1.py
    This question is about creating a custom iterator for making subsets of a given list, by the following conditions;
        1. each subset's sum must not be over the given value (C).
        2. must not creating all subsets first' only on-the-run.
        
    The function bounded_subsets returns a list of lists of valid subsets from the given list, that accepts the aboe conditions.
    
### Q2 - Strategy - q2.py
    This question is about the OOP principle of Strategy - multiple ways to solve a problem.
    The problem i chose to work on is the Connected Components of a given Graph.
    The algorithms that problem can be solved with are:
        1. BFS - Breadth First Search
        2. DFS - Depth First Search
    
    Both are compatable with the main function connectedComponents which accepts one of the above as an argument 'algorithm'.
        
    The possible output types of this strategy are:
        1. sizes of components
        2. the components by themselves
    
    Both are compatable with the main function connectedComponents which accepts one of the above as an argument 'output_type'.
